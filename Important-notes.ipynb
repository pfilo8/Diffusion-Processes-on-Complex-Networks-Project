    "* In contrast other studies, in our model the changes are reversible which means that spinsons can unadopt. A similar idea of rejection has been introduced by Goldenberg et al. [21]. They use four states to describe a consumer: 0 for unadopted, 1 for adopted and satisfied, −1 for adopted and dissatisfied, and 2 for a ‘rejecter’. From this point of view, a down-spinson (↓) in our model can be interpreted as a consumer who has not adopted (which corresponds to state 0) or such who adopted but for various reasons has switched back to the old product/service (which corresponds to state 2). Note, however, that in [21] a rejecter (state 2) is an absorbing state, i.e. cannot change, whereas in our model all changes are potentially reversible.\n",
